Paragraph more or less longer but you can add *emphazis* and /italic/ text inside.
But if you have added a variable you can use it: 
Hello $/name
You can also use an inline @/link (https://example.com)

" -- Citation Block
" -> Author

> -- Code Block
> -- Code Block line 2

@ Link Text (https://example.com)


& -- Image (source)
& -> caption

// The anchor is a good way to add a custom link
// to your own file anytime you want
// You can go to your anchor with :

Go to my @/anchor (name of the anchor)
