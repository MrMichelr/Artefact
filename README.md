## Welcome to Artefact

**Artefact** is a simple Templating language. His goal is to write document quickly, with structure and readability.

Artefact is based on a simple concept. Each start of a line begins with an artifact (symbol or sequence of symbols) that defines the type of content that will be seen afterwards.
